`pxltrm` is a terminal pixel art editor written in pure bash. Draw pixel art
without a mouse using intuitive hotkeys.

- Fast (*Less than 150 lines of pure bash*).
- Lightweight (*Low on CPU/Memory usage*).
- Supports 256 color terminal palette.
- Supports all hex colors (*through true-color terminals*).
- Undo/Redo of open screens.
- Save/Load screens.
- View saved screens with `cat`.
- Use any character or string as a brush.
- Responds to window resize.
- Vim `hjkl` movement.

**Note:** This is a work in-progress. When you break it, let me know!
